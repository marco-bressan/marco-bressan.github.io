	abstract = {Objectives To determine which class of non-opioid analgesics – paracetamol (acetaminophen), NSAIDs or COX-2 inhibitors – is the most effective at reducing morphine consumption and associated adverse effects when used as part of multimodal analgesia following major surgery. Data sources A systematic literature review was conducted using MEDLINE, EMBASE and CENTRAL databases, searched from January 2003 to February 2009 and updating an earlier review. Review methods Randomised controlled trials comparing paracetamol, NSAIDs or COX-2 inhibitors to each other or placebo, in adults receiving patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) with morphine following major surgery, were included. The COX-2 inhibitors rofecoxib and valdecoxib were excluded. Only trials that reported 24-hour morphine consumption were included. Other outcomes of interest were morphine-related adverse effects and adverse effects related to the non-opioids. Adequacy of randomisation, concealment of allocation, double blinding, and the flow of patients within the trial was assessed. The main analysis was a mixed treatment comparison (MTC) evaluating the relative effects of the four treatment classes. Four main outcomes were prioritised: 24-hour morphine consumption, sedation, nausea and vomiting, and surgical bleeding. Studies reporting nausea alone were pooled with studies reporting postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV). Comparisons were described as statistically significant (at 5\% level) when the credibility interval (CrI) did not cross 1 for odds ratio (OR) and zero for mean difference (MD). Trials making direct comparisons between the active interventions were also pooled in a meta-analysis using a random effects model. Sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the effects of study quality, individual drugs, and baseline morphine consumption. Results Sixty relevant studies were identified. When paracetamol, NSAIDs or COX-2 inhibitors were added to PCA morphine, there was a statistically significant reduction in morphine consumption: paracetamol (MD –6.34 mg; 95\% CrI –9.02 to –3.65); NSAIDs (MD –10.18; 95\% CrI –11.65 to –8.72); and COX-2 inhibitors (MD –10.92; 95\% CrI –12.77 to –9.08). NSAIDs and COX-2 inhibitors were both significantly better than paracetamol, and there was no significant difference between NSAIDs and COX-2 inhibitors (MD –0.74; 95\% CrI –3.03 to 1.56). There was a significant reduction in nausea and PONV with NSAIDs compared to placebo (OR 0.70; 95\% CrI 0.53 to 0.88) but not for paracetamol or COX-2 inhibitors, nor for NSAIDs compared to paracetamol or COX-2 inhibitors. Conclusions 24-hour morphine consumption decreased by 6.3 mg to 10.9 mg, compared to placebo, when paracetamol, NSAID or COX-2 inhibitors were added to PCA morphine following surgery. Differences in effect between the three drug classes were small and unlikely to be of clinical significance. There does not appear to be a strong case for recommending routine addition of any of the three non-opioids to PCA morphine in the 24 hours immediately after surgery, or for favouring one drug class above the others.},

            Control risk regression is a diffuse approach for meta‐analysis about the effectiveness of a treatment, relating the measure of risk with which the outcome occurs in the treated group to that in the control group. The severity of illness is a source of between‐study heterogeneity that can be difficult to measure. It can be approximated by the rate of events in the control group. Since the estimate is a surrogate for the underlying risk, it is prone to measurement error. Correction methods are necessary to provide reliable inference. This article illustrates the extent of measurement error effects under different scenarios, including departures from the classical normality assumption for the control risk distribution. The performance of different measurement error corrections is examined. Attention will be paid to likelihood‐based structural methods assuming a distribution for the control risk measure and to functional methods avoiding the assumption, namely, a simulation‐based method and two score function methods. Advantages and limits of the approaches are evaluated through simulation. In case of large heterogeneity, structural approaches are preferable to score methods, while score methods perform better for small heterogeneity and small sample size. The simulation‐based approach has a satisfactory behavior whichever the examined scenario, with no convergence issues. The methods are applied to a meta‐analysis about the association between diabetes and risk of Parkinson disease. The study intends to make researchers aware of the measurement error problem occurring in control risk regression and lead them to the use of appropriate correction techniques to prevent fallacious conclusions.},

	abstract = {In network meta‐analyses that synthesize direct and indirect comparison evidence concerning multiple treatments, multivariate random effects models have been routinely used for addressing between‐studies heterogeneities. Although their standard inference methods depend on large sample approximations (eg, restricted maximum likelihood estimation) for the number of trials synthesized, the numbers of trials are often moderate or small. In these situations, standard estimators cannot be expected to behave in accordance with asymptotic theory; in particular, confidence intervals cannot be assumed to exhibit their nominal coverage probabilities (also, the type I error probabilities of the corresponding tests cannot be retained). The invalidity issue may seriously influence the overall conclusions of network meta‐analyses. In this article, we develop several improved inference methods for network meta‐analyses to resolve these problems. We first introduce 2 efficient likelihood‐based inference methods, the likelihood ratio test–based and efficient score test–based methods, in a general framework of network meta‐analysis. Then, to improve the small‐sample inferences, we developed improved higher‐order asymptotic methods using Bartlett‐type corrections and bootstrap adjustment methods. The proposed methods adopt Monte Carlo approaches using parametric bootstraps to effectively circumvent complicated analytical calculations of case‐by‐case analyses and to permit flexible application to various statistical models network meta‐analyses. These methods can also be straightforwardly applied to multivariate meta‐regression analyses and to tests for the evaluation of inconsistency. In numerical evaluations via simulations, the proposed methods generally performed well compared with the ordinary restricted maximum likelihood–based inference method. Applications to 2 network meta‐analysis datasets are provided.},

	abstract = {Abstract
          Network meta-analysis, also known as mixed treatments comparison meta-analysis or multiple treatments meta-analysis, extends conventional pairwise meta-analysis by simultaneously synthesizing multiple interventions in a single integrated analysis. Despite the growing popularity of network meta-analysis within comparative effectiveness research, it comes with potential challenges. For example, within-study correlations among treatment comparisons are rarely reported in the published literature. Yet, these correlations are pivotal for valid statistical inference. As demonstrated in earlier studies, ignoring these correlations can inflate mean squared errors of the resulting point estimates and lead to inaccurate standard error estimates. This paper introduces a composite likelihood-based approach that ensures accurate statistical inference without requiring knowledge of the within-study correlations. The proposed method is computationally robust and efficient, with substantially reduced computational time compared to the state-of-the-science methods implemented in R packages. The proposed method was evaluated through extensive simulations and applied to two important applications including a network meta-analysis comparing interventions for primary open-angle glaucoma, and another comparing treatments for chronic prostatitis and chronic pelvic pain syndrome.

This method provides an alternative way to make inference on diagnostic measures such as sensitivity, specificity, likelihood ratios and diagnostic odds ratio. Its main advantages over the standard likelihood method are the avoidance of the non-convergence problem, which is non-trivial when the number of studies are relatively small, the computational simplicity and some robustness to model mis-specifications. Simulation studies show that the composite likelihood method maintains high relative efficiency compared to that of the standard likelihood method.

A new, promising, but also very much debated extension of systematic reviews, mixed treatment comparison (MTC) meta-analysis, has become increasingly popular recently. MTC meta-analysis may have value in interpreting the available randomized evidence from networks of trials and can rank many different treatments, going beyond focusing on simple pairwise-comparisons. Nevertheless, the evaluation of networks also presents special challenges and caveats. In this article, we review the statistical methodology for MTC meta-analysis. We discuss the concept of inconsistency and methods that have been proposed to evaluate it as well as the methodological gaps that remain.

	abstract = {This paper investigates the use of likelihood methods for meta‐analysis, within the random‐effects models framework. We show that likelihood inference relying on first‐order approximations, while improving common meta‐analysis techniques, can be prone to misleading results. This drawback is very evident in the case of small sample sizes, which are typical in meta‐analysis. We alleviate the problem by exploiting the theory of higher‐order asymptotics. In particular, we focus on a second‐order adjustment to the log‐likelihood ratio statistic. Simulation studies in meta‐analysis and meta‐regression show that higher‐order likelihood inference provides much more accurate results than its first‐order counterpart, while being of a computationally feasible form. We illustrate the application of the proposed approach on a real example. Copyright © 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Baseline risk is a proxy for unmeasured but important patient‐level characteristics, which may be modifiers of treatment effect, and is a potential source of heterogeneity in meta‐analysis. Models adjusting for baseline risk have been developed for pairwise meta‐analysis using the observed event rate in the placebo arm and taking into account the measurement error in the covariate to ensure that an unbiased estimate of the relationship is obtained. Our objective is to extend these methods to network meta‐analysis where it is of interest to adjust for baseline imbalances in the non‐intervention group event rate to reduce both heterogeneity and possibly inconsistency. This objective is complicated in network meta‐analysis by this covariate being sometimes missing, because of the fact that not all studies in a network may have a non‐active intervention arm. A random‐effects meta‐regression model allowing for inclusion of multi‐arm trials and trials without a ‘non‐intervention’ arm is developed. Analyses are conducted within a Bayesian framework using the WinBUGS software. The method is illustrated using two examples: (i) interventions to promote functional smoke alarm ownership by households with children and (ii) analgesics to reduce post‐operative morphine consumption following a major surgery. The results showed no evidence of baseline effect in the smoke alarm example, but the analgesics example shows that the adjustment can greatly reduce heterogeneity and improve overall model fit.

The aim is to make more accessible an important development in statistical theory and practice. The software, implemented in an R package, requires only that the user provide code to compute the likelihood function and to specify extra-likelihood aspects of the model, such as stopping rule or censoring model, through a function generating a dataset under the model. The exposition charts a narrow course through the developments, intending thereby to make these more widely accessible. It includes the likelihood ratio approximation to the distribution of the maximum likelihood estimator, that is the p * formula, and the transformation of this yielding a second-order approximation to the distribution of the signed likelihood ratio test statistic, based on a modified signed likelihood ratio statistic r*. This follows developments of Barndorff-Nielsen and others. The software utilises the approximation to required Jacobians as developed by Skovgaard, which is included in the exposition. Several examples of using the software are provided.},

	abstract = {Multivariate meta-analysis allows the joint synthesis of summary estimates from multiple end points and accounts for their within-study and between-study correlation. Yet practitioners usually meta-analyse each end point independently. I examine the role of within-study correlation in multivariate meta-analysis, to elicit the consequences of ignoring it. Using analytic reasoning and a simulation study, the within-study correlation is shown to inﬂuence the ‘borrowing of strength’ across end points, and wrongly ignoring it gives meta-analysis results with generally inferior statistical properties; for example, on average it increases the mean-square error and standard error of pooled estimates, and for non-ignorable missing data it increases their bias. The inﬂuence of within-study correlation is only negligible when the within-study variation is small relative to the between-study variation, or when very small differences exist across studies in the within-study covariance matrices.The ﬁndings are demonstrated by applied examples within medicine, dentistry and education. Meta-analysts are thus encouraged to account for the correlation between end points. To facilitate this, I conclude by reviewing options for multivariate meta-analysis when within-study correlations are unknown; these include obtaining individual patient data, using external information, performing sensitivity analyses and using alternatively parameterized models.},

	abstract = {Methods—We included randomized controlled trials that compared a single active topical medication with no treatment/placebo or another single topical medication. We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Food and Drug Administration's website. Two individuals independently assessed trial eligibility, abstracted data, and assessed the risk of bias. We performed Bayesian network meta-analyses.
Results—We included 114 randomized controlled trials with data from 20,275 participants. The overall risk of bias of the included trials is mixed. The mean reductions (95\% credible intervals) in IOP in mmHg at 3 months, ordered from the most to least effective drugs were: bimatoprost 5·61 (4·94; 6·29), latanoprost 4·85 (4·24; 5·46), travoprost 4·83 (4·12; 5·54), levobunolol 4·51 (3·85; 5·24), tafluprost 4·37 (2·94; 5·83), timolol 3·7 (3·16; 4·24), brimonidine 3·59 (2·89; 4·29), carteolol 3·44 (2·42; 4·46), levobetaxolol 2·56 (1·52; 3·62), apraclonidine 2·52 (0·94; 4·11), dorzolamide 2·49 (1·85; 3·13), brinzolamide 2·42 (1·62; 3·23), betaxolol 2·24 (1·59; 2·88), and unoprostone 1·91 (1·15; 2·67).
Conclusions—All active first-line drugs are effective compared to placebo in reducing IOP at 3 months. Bimatoprost, latanoprost, and travoprost are among the most efficacious drugs, although the within class differences were small and may not be clinically meaningful. All factors, including adverse effects, patient preferences, and cost should be considered in selecting a drug for a given patient.},

Plotting measurements of the population risk against the treatment effect estimates for a group of clinical trials may reveal an apparent association, suggesting that differences in the population risk might explain heterogeneity in the results of clinical trials. In this paper we consider using estimates of population risk to explain treatment effect heterogeneity, and show that using these estimates as fixed covariates will result in bias. This bias depends on the treatment effect and population risk definitions chosen, and the magnitude of measurement errors. To account for the effect of measurement error, we represent clinical trials in a bivariate two-level hierarchical model, and show how to estimate the parameters of the model by both maximum likelihood and Bayes procedures. We use two examples to demonstrate the method.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To examine the temporal relationship between accumulating data from randomized control trials of treatments for myocardial infarction and the recommendations of clinical experts writing review articles and textbook chapters.
DATA SOURCES: (1) MEDLINE search from 1966 to present; search terms used were myocardial infarction, clinical trials, multicenter studies, double-blind method, meta-analysis, and the text word "random:"; (2) references from pertinent articles and books; and (3) all editions of English-language general medical texts and manuals and review articles on treatment of myocardial infarction.
STUDY SELECTION: Randomized control trials of therapies for reducing the risk of total mortality in myocardial infarction (acute and secondary prevention). Review articles and textbook chapters dealing with the general clinical management of patients with myocardial infarction.
DATA EXTRACTION: Two authors read the material and recorded the results; disagreements were resolved by conference.
DATA SYNTHESIS: We used the technique of cumulative meta-analysis (performing a new meta-analysis when the results of a new clinical trial are published) and compared the results with the recommendations of the experts for various treatments for myocardial infarction. Discrepancies were detected between the meta-analytic patterns of effectiveness in the randomized trials and the recommendations of reviewers. Review articles often failed to mention important advances or exhibited delays in recommending effective preventive measures. In some cases, treatments that have no effect on mortality or are potentially harmful continued to be recommended by several clinical experts.
CONCLUSIONS: Finding and analyzing all therapeutic trials in a given field has become such a difficult and specialized task that the clinical experts called on to summarize the evidence in a timely fashion need access to better databases and new statistical techniques to assist them in this important task.},

The approach accounts for the measurement error affecting the information about either the outcome in the treatment group or the baseline risk available from each study, while requiring no assumption about the distribution of the true unobserved baseline risk. This robustness property, together with the feasibility of computation, makes {SIMEX} very attractive. The approach is suggested as an alternative to the usual likelihood analysis, which can provide misleading inferential results when the commonly assumed normal distribution for the baseline risk is violated. The performance of {SIMEX} is compared to the likelihood method and to the moment‐based correction through an extensive simulation study and the analysis of two datasets from the medical literature.

The relationship is commonly described with a linear model taking into account the fact that the latent baseline risk is estimated from a finite sample and thus subjected to measurement error. Depending on the specific assumption about the latent baseline risks, two different classes of methods can be pursued. In the literature, it is commonly assumed that the latent baseline risks are sampled from a (normal) distribution. Such methods are often criticised for needing a distribution. Here, we propose the use of methods that require no distributional assumption on the baseline risks.
